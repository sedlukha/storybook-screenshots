Screenshot every Storybook story with Playwright. Drop a config file in your
repo, run one command — it builds Storybook, serves it, walks the story index,
and captures a baseline per story across the browsers, viewports, and themes you
declare.

## Why?

Storybook is already an inventory of every UI state you care about. This turns
that inventory into pixel baselines for visual-regression testing, without you
writing a test per component. Framework-agnostic: any Storybook 8 / 9 / 10.

## Install

```sh
npm i -D storybook-screenshots @playwright/test
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

`@playwright/test` is a peer dependency. Node ≥ 22.

## Quick start

Add a config to your repo root:

```js
// storybook-screenshots.config.mjs
/** @type {import('storybook-screenshots').StorybookScreenshotsConfig} */
export default {
  buildCommand: "npm run build-storybook",
  snapshotDir: "screenshots/__screenshots__",
  themes: [
    { name: "light", globals: { theme: "light" } },
    { name: "dark", globals: { theme: "dark" } },
  ],
}
```

Add scripts and run:

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "screenshots": "storybook-screenshots",
    "screenshots:update": "storybook-screenshots --update"
  }
}
```

```sh
npm run screenshots:update   # write baselines (first run / intentional changes)
npm run screenshots          # compare against committed baselines
```

Commit the generated PNGs. On later runs a changed story fails the command with
a Playwright diff.

## CLI

```sh
storybook-screenshots            # build + serve + compare
storybook-screenshots --update   # write/refresh baselines
storybook-screenshots --config ./path/to/config.mjs
```

The CLI looks for the nearest `storybook-screenshots.config.mjs` (or `.js`),
walking up from the current directory.

Baselines are written to `<snapshotDir>/<browser>-<viewport>[-<theme>]/<story-id>.png`.

## Themes

Each theme maps to Storybook globals applied through the preview iframe, so it
works with whatever theming your Storybook already exposes (a `theme` global, a
toolbar, decorators…). `{ name: "dark", globals: { theme: "dark" } }` loads each
story with `?globals=theme:dark` and stores its baselines under a `…-dark`
folder.

## CI

Generate baselines on one OS (CI) so they are deterministic — font rendering
differs across platforms. To turn a CI run's baseline changes into a reviewable
pull request automatically, pair this with
[`sedlukha/snapshot-autofix-pr`](https://github.com/sedlukha/snapshot-autofix-pr):

```yaml
- run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
- run: npm run screenshots:update
- uses: sedlukha/snapshot-autofix-pr@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    snapshot-glob: "screenshots/__screenshots__/**"
```

## How it works

1. Builds Storybook (`buildCommand`) or uses an existing `storybookDir`.
2. Serves the static build over a local HTTP server (no extra dependency).
3. Reads `index.json` and creates one Playwright test per story.
4. Loads each story's iframe, waits for Storybook's `sb-show-main` signal, then
   `toHaveScreenshot`. A render failure surfaces the Storybook error and console
   output instead of a blind timeout.
